            Conflict is one of the leading causes of hunger and poverty and a fact of life in many of the communities where Concern works
        </h1>
        <P>It’s often a deciding factor when we enter a new country, creating large humanitarian needs especially around hunger and poverty. Last year, Concern began to respond to these needs in Ukraine. In 2021, similar circumstances led to us establishing programmes in Burkina Faso. Here are the stories behind those — and 12 other countries in conflict where we are currently at work. </P>
     <p>Despite development advances in recent years, Afghanistan remains an extremely volatile and fragile country following nearly four decades of instability. Violence continues to undermine the country’s development, with almost two thirds of the Afghan population living in areas directly affected by conflict. Between 2009 and 2022, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that there were 111,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan. 

        This has a direct impact on humanitarian aid. Before the US military withdrew from the country in 2021, over 18 million people required humanitarian assistance — including over 3 million children. This was double the number of people who required assistance compared to January 2020. Today, UNOCHA estimates that 28.3 million people require humanitarian assistance. </p>
