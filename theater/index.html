     <h1>History of our theater</h1>
     <p>Over 2,000 years have passed without a break in the history of Indian theatre. <br>                  

      Ancient India produced a comprehensive guide to theatre called Natyashastra, credited to Bharata, almost simultaneously with Aristotle’s poetics.<br>
       This work served as the foundation for Indian theatrical styles for centuries to come.<br>

      This indicates that a rich legacy of performance practise existed long before a piece like this did.<br>
      
      For more than a thousand years, Indian aesthetic philosophy and practise were influenced by the aesthetic theory of rasa.<br>
      
   <br>   A significant body of Sanskrit drama written by prominent playwrights like Bhasa, Kalidasa, Shudraka, Vishakadatta, Bhavabhuti, and Harsha was also produced during the first century. This body of work is comparable in scope and impact to other strong theatrical traditions around the world.
      Before the advent of cinema, this style of professional theatre presented by professional groups, sometimes travelling, was the only source of mass entertainment.
      <br> It originated in newly emerging metropolitan towns like Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai in the late 19th century. Their productions set the standard for Indian cinema with their focus on song, spectacle, and melodrama. By the 1970s, popular cinema had mostly replaced entertainment theatre, with the exception of few regions like Maharashtra and Assam.
     <br> The theatre landscape underwent a dramatic upheaval shortly after India gained its independence in 1947. The effects of IPTA started to fade. Entertainment theatre suffered a setback as a result of competition from more widely seen film genres. Major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bangalore continued to see a thriving amateur theatre scene.

The Shri Prithviraj Kapoor Memorial Trust & Research Foundation is the parent organisation of the Prithvi Theatre. The Prithvi Theatre depends on the support of individuals and corporations devoted to the growth of the performing and fine arts for its existence as a wholly non-profit organisation.
